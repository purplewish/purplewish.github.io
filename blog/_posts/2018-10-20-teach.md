title:  Teaching is difficult

I have been teaching in Probability for almost two months. I spend a lot of time on teaching, but sometimes I am upset since it seems that what I have done is useless sometimes. Sometimes when I teach in front and there is no feedback, I just want to stop and go outside. But I know I cannot do that. I remember that the fist day of orientation, one student said don't expect that everything is easy for them. Now I understand that. Most of the things in this course are new for them which makes me think about the first time I learned probability, yes, it was difficult. However, what should I do to make myself feel better? No solutions yet.
